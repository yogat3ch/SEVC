Why is the course ten days long?</button></h4><div id="collapse01" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading01"><div class="accordion-body">Actually, the ten-day course is the minimum; it provides an essential introduction and foundation to the technique. To develop in the practice is a lifetime job. Experience over generations has shown that if Vipassana is taught in periods of less than ten days, the student does not get a sufficient experiential grasp of the technique. Traditionally, Vipassana was taught in retreats lasting seven weeks. With the dawning of the 20th century, the teachers of this tradition began to experiment with shorter times to suit the quickening pace of life. They tried thirty days, two weeks, ten days, down to seven days--and they found that less than ten days is not enough time for the mind to settle down and work deeply with the mind-body phenomenon.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading02"><button href="#collapse02" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse02" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse02">2.

Every evening at 7:00 p.m. there is a videotaped lecture by the Teacher, S.N. Goenka, which provides a context for meditators to understand their experience of the day. This schedule has proved workable and beneficial for hundreds of thousands of people for decades.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading03"><button href="#collapse03" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse03" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse03">3.

N. Goenka speaking in English. We have many students whose native language is not English. Course recordings are available in nearly 50 languages, and some courses are taught with dual language instructions and discourses by teachers who are bi-lingual. If English is not your native language, someone from the center will contact you to discuss how we can accommodate you.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading04"><button href="#collapse04" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse04" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse04">4.

There is no charge for either the teaching, or for room and board. All Vipassana courses worldwide are run on a strictly voluntary donation basis. At the end of your course, if you have benefited from the experience, you are welcome to donate for the coming course, according to your volition and your means.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading05"><button href="#collapse05" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse05" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse05">5. How much are teachers paid to conduct courses?</button></h4><div id="collapse05" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading05"><div class="accordion-body">Teachers receive no payment, donations or other material benefit. They are required to have their own private means of support. This rule means that some of them may have less time for teaching, but it protects students from exploitation and it guards against commercialism. In this tradition, teachers give Vipassana purely as a service to others. All they receive is the satisfaction of seeing people's happiness from the practice.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading06"><button href="#collapse06" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse06" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse06">6.

If the diet is too specialized or would interfere with meditation, we might have to ask you to wait until you can be more flexible. We're sorry but students are required to choose from the food provided to them, rather than bring food for themselves. Most people find the choice is ample and they enjoy the simple vegetarian diet.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading08"><button href="#collapse08" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse08" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse08">8.

Why is a course conducted in silence?</button></h4><div id="collapse09" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading09"><div class="accordion-body">All students attending the course observe "noble silence" — that is, silence of body, speech and mind. They agree to refrain from communicating with their co-meditators. However, students are free to contact the management about their material needs, and to speak with the instructor. Silence is observed for the first nine full days. On the tenth day, speech is resumed as a way of re-establishing the normal pattern of daily life. Continuity of practice is the secret of success in this course; silence is an essential component in maintaining this continuity.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading10"><button href="#collapse10" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse10" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse10">10. Why do I have to stay for the entire ten days?</button></h4><div id="collapse10" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading10"><div class="accordion-body">Vipassana is taught step by step, with a new step added each day to the end of the course. If you leave early, you do not learn the full teaching and do not give the technique a chance to work for you. Also, by meditating intensively, a course participant initiates a process that reaches fulfillment with the completion of the course. Interrupting the process before completion is not advisable.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading11"><button href="#collapse11" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse11" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse11">11. Is it dangerous to leave a course early?</button></h4><div id="collapse11" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading11"><div class="accordion-body">The point is that leaving early is shortchanging yourself. You don't give yourself a chance to learn the full technique and so you won't be able to apply it successfully in daily life. You also interrupt the process in the middle rather than letting it come to the proper conclusion. To get home a day or two early, you waste all the time you have invested.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading12"><button href="#collapse12" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse12" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse12">12.

Can I leave then?</button></h4><div id="collapse12" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading12"><div class="accordion-body">The tenth day is a very important transition back to ordinary life.

If you are able to follow the instructions patiently and diligently, you can be sure of tangible results. Though it may appear daunting, the day's schedule is neither too severe nor too relaxed. Moreover, the presence of other students practicing conscientiously in a peaceful and conducive atmosphere lends tremendous support to one's efforts.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading14"><button href="#collapse14" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse14" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse14">14.

Can Vipassana cure physical or mental diseases?</button></h4><div id="collapse15" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading15"><div class="accordion-body">Many diseases are caused by our inner agitation. If the agitation is removed, the disease may be alleviated or disappear. But learning Vipassana with the aim of curing a disease is a mistake that never works. People who try to do this waste their time because they are focusing on the wrong goal. They may even harm themselves. They will neither understand the meditation properly nor succeed in getting rid of the disease.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading16"><button href="#collapse16" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse16" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse16">16.

Does Vipassana cure that?</button></h4><div id="collapse16" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#qanda" aria-labelledby="heading16"><div class="accordion-body">Again, the purpose of Vipassana is not to cure diseases. Someone who really practices Vipassana learns to be happy and balanced in all circumstances. But a person with a history of severe depression may not be able to apply the technique properly and may not get the desired results. The best thing for such a person is to work with a health professional. Vipassana teachers are meditation experts, not psychotherapists.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading17"><button href="#collapse17" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse17" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse17">17.

Vipassana teaches ​awareness and equani​mity, that is, balance, despite the inevitable ups and downs of life. But if someone comes to a course concealing ​a ​serious emotional ​history​, that person may be unable to understand the technique or to apply it properly to achieve the desired results. This is why it is important to ​communicate with us about your past history so that we can ​assist you in determining whether you will benefit from a course.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h4 class="accordion-header" id="heading18"><button href="#collapse18" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse18" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse18">18.

Vipassana is an art of living, a way of life.
