    Now that Vipassana centers around the world have closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, many students are interested in sitting a self-course at home or in another non-center location. The following document was developed with input from Teachers in North America and Europe.

    <strong id="srq1">What is a “self-course”?</strong>
    
    A self-course is a Vipassana meditation course that you sit on your own, without any guidance or with minimal guidance from an assistant teacher.
    
    <strong id="srq2">Am I qualified to sit a self-course? Do I need to get permission?</strong>
    
    In principle, anyone who has successfully completed a 10-day Vipassana course as taught by S.N. Goenka can decide to do a self-course. It’s a good idea to discuss your plans with an assistant teacher, who can help with any questions you may have. Contact your local center to be put in touch with an assistant teacher.
    
    <strong id="srq3">How many days is a self-course?</strong>
    
    You can sit a full 10 days, starting on the evening of Day 0 and finishing on the morning of Day 11. You can also choose to sit any period shorter than that. Don’t attempt to sit longer than 10 days on your own.
    
    <strong id="srq4">Where can I sit a self-course?</strong>
    
    Usually, people sit a self-course in their home or the home of a fellow Vipassana meditator. Do not try sitting a course at a place used for a different spiritual practice.
    
    <strong id="srq5">If I am not sitting at a center, what sort of place is suitable for a self-course?</strong>
    
    The place should be private, quiet and self-contained, with everything you’ll need during your course: a bedroom, a meditation place (either a separate room or a corner of your bedroom), a full bathroom, a kitchen/dining area, if possible an outdoor walking area. It should be a place where you will not be disturbed. Decide on the course boundaries before you start. As far as possible, the course area should not contain distractions. It should not contain any religious objects. Turn off and put away electronic devices that you won’t need. If you are using an electronic device as an alarm clock or for playing recordings, set it in airplane mode, disconnect from Wi-Fi and disable notifications. Put away reading matter in a place where it won’t attract your attention. Do not go out of the course boundaries from the beginning to the end of the course. Do not communicate with the outside world until after you finish the course.
    
    <strong id="srq6">Can two or more people sit a self-course together?</strong>
    
    Certainly, but it’s best to have separate bedrooms even if they are the same gender. If men and women are sitting together, they need separate bedrooms, bathrooms and eating areas.
    
    <strong id="srq7">What about meals?</strong>
    
    A friend or family member may offer to cook for you, or you can have meals delivered. Otherwise, you can do your own cooking. But keep food preparation simple, and make sure it doesn’t interfere with meditation hours. Meals must be vegetarian without eggs. Have all the necessary ingredients on hand at the start of the course, or else have someone bring the groceries you need.
    
    <strong id="srq8">Is any guidance available to me in a self-course?</strong>
    
    Some centers may give you the name of an assistant teacher to be contacted if you have questions or difficulties during your self-course. More usually, self-course students work on their own.
    
    <strong id="srq9">How do I prepare myself for sitting a self-course?</strong>
    
    Go through the <a href="https://www.patapa.dhamma.org/code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code of Conduct</a> and make sure you are familiar with it. This is your handbook for the course. Make sure you have any recordings you will want to play during the course (see following question), as well as a device on which to play them. From the start of the course until after you start practicing Metta, you’ll be observing Noble Silence. That includes not checking your phone for messages. Warn friends and family that you’ll be unavailable during this time, but arrange a way for them to contact you in case of an emergency.
    
    <strong id="srq10">What recordings can I listen to during a self-course?</strong>
    
    You can play the following recordings:
    <ul>
         <li>Goenkaji’s early-morning chanting</li>
         <li>group sittings</li>
         <li>the 10-day discourses</li>
    </ul>
    You can download these before the course starts from <a href="http://www.discourses.dhamma.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discourses.dhamma.org</a>.
    Contact a center near you for the username and password.
    You can also download the material from the Dhamma.org Mobile App for iOS and
    Android. Go to the <a href="http://www.dhamma.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dhamma.org</a> home page for links to download the mobile app.
    Some of the material is available on CD from <a href="http://www.pariyatti.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pariyatti.org</a>.
    Any other recordings with teaching instructions are for use only in a course led by an assistant teacher.
    
    <strong id="srq11">What’s the day-by-day program in a self-course?</strong>
    
    Before you start, make a strong determination (adhiṭṭhāna) to complete the self-course, following the precepts and the timetable.
    On the first evening, repeat the opening formalities (see page 5):
    <ul>
         <li>Take refuge in Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.</li>
         <li>Take Eight Precepts. If you have a health issue, you can relax the Sixth Precept and
    have something light to eat at 5:00 and/or 9:00 p.m.</li>
         <li>Surrender to the Buddha and your present teacher.</li>
         <li>Request to be taught Anapana meditation so that you can experience the peace of
    nibbāna within yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    Then start practicing Anapana.
    Continue with Anapana for the first third of your course and then switch over to Vipassana. This will be on the afternoon of Day 4 if you are sitting 10 days. If your course is shorter, adjust the timing as appropriate.
    Devote at least an hour to the first sitting of Vipassana. Start by making a request to be taught Vipassana meditation so that you can experience the peace of nibbāna within yourself. Practice Anapana for a little while and then switch to Vipassana.
    After you start Vipassana, the three one-hour group sittings each day are sittings of strong determination (adhiṭṭhāna). That is, you try to meditate as seriously as you can without changing your position. If it becomes too uncomfortable, move as little as possible while trying to keep your focus, and then continue meditating without any sense of defeat. Don’t try adhiṭṭhāna sittings at other times. Outside the one-hour group sittings, work at your own pace and change position or take a short break when you need to.
    From 9:00 a.m. on Day 10, start practicing Metta. If your course is shorter than 10 days, start Metta earlier. Afterwards, allow yourself to relax a little in preparation for going back to ordinary life. Once you start practicing Metta, you can talk with people at the course site. Do not communicate with the outside world until after you finish the course.
    At the end, share your merits with all beings.
    
    <strong id="srq12">What’s the daily timetable in a self-course?</strong>
    
    Follow the same timetable as in a regular 10-day course:

    <strong id="srq13">If I do a 10-day self-course, can I count it as one of the courses required for me to qualify for a Satipatthana course or a long course?</strong>
    
    Unfortunately, no. You can only count courses that were conducted by an assistant
    teacher.
    
    <strong id="srq14">What if I still have questions about sitting a self-course?</strong>
    
    Contact a center where you recently sat or an assistant teacher who knows you.

    <h2>Guidelines For Practicing</h2>
    </center>
    <center>
    <h1>Vipassana Meditation</h1>
    </center>
    
    <hr>
    
    A Vipassana course is truly valuable only if it makes a change in your life, and a change
    will come only if you keep practicing the technique on a daily basis.
    The following outline of what you have learned is offered with best wishes
    for your continued success in meditation.
    
    <center>
    <h3>Sila</h3>
    </center>
    
    In daily life this is practiced by following the Five Precepts:
    <ul>
         <li>to abstain from killing any being,</li>
         <li>to abstain from stealing,</li>
         <li>to abstain from sexual misconduct,</li>
         <li>to abstain from wrong speech,</li>
         <li>to abstain from all intoxicants.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>Meditation</h3>
    </center>
    
    The minimum needed to maintain the practice:
    <ul>
         <li>one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening,</li>
         <li>five minutes while lying in bed before you fall asleep and after you wake up,</li>
         <li>if possible, sitting once a week for one hour with other meditators practicing this technique of Vipassana,</li>
         <li>a ten-day course or self-course once a year,</li>
         <li>and other free time for meditation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to meditate in daily practice:</h4>
    <strong>Anapana</strong>
    Practice this if the mind is dull or agitated, if it is difficult to feel sensations or
    difficult not to react to them. You can begin with Anapana and then switch to
    Vipassana or, if needed, continue observing the breath for the entire hour. To
    practice Anapana, keep the attention in the area below the nostrils and above
    the upper lip. Remain aware of each breath as it enters or leaves. If the mind
    is very dull or very agitated, breathe deliberately and slightly harder for some
    time. Otherwise, the breathing should be natural.
    
    <strong>Vipassana</strong>
    Move your attention systematically from head to feet and from feet to head,
    observing in order each and every part of the body by feeling all the sensations
    that you come across. Observe objectively; that is, remain equanimous with all
    the sensations that you experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, by
    appreciating their impermanent nature. Keep your attention moving. Never
    stay for more than a few minutes at any one place. Do not allow the practice
    to become mechanical. Work in different ways according to the type of sensations
    you experience. Areas of the body having different gross sensations
    should be observed separately by moving the attention part by part. Symmetrical
    parts, such as both arms or both legs, having similar subtle sensations, may
    be observed together simultaneously. If you experience subtle sensations
    throughout the physical structure, you may at times sweep the entire body and
    then again work part by part.
    
    <strong>Metta</strong>
    At the end of the hour relax, letting any mental or physical agitation subside.
    Then focus your attention for a few minutes on subtle sensations in the body,
    and fill your mind and body with thoughts and feelings of goodwill for all
    beings.
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>Outside of Meditation Periods</h3>
    </center>
    
    Give your full and undivided attention to any important tasks before you, but check
    from time to time whether you are maintaining your awareness and equanimity. Whenever a problem
    arises, if possible be aware of your breath or sensations, even for a few seconds.
    This will help you to remain balanced in various situations.
    
    <strong>Dana</strong>
    Share whatever good you have acquired with others. Doing so helps to eradicate the
    old habit of self-centeredness. Meditators realize that the most valuable thing they
    have to share is Dhamma. Not being able to teach, they do what they can to help
    others learn the technique. With this pure volition they donate toward the expenses
    of other students.
    
    This <i>dana</i> is the sole source of funding for courses and centers around the world.
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>Selfless Service</h3>
    </center>
    
    A still greater <i>dana</i> is to give of one's time and effort by helping to organize or run
    courses or by doing other Dhamma work. All who help (including the Teachers and
    Assistant Teachers) give their service as <i>dana</i> without receiving anything in return.
    This service not only benefits others, but also helps those offering it to eradicate
    egotism. to understand the teaching more deeply, and thus to advance on the path.
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>One Path Only</h3>
    </center>
    
    Do not mix this technique with others. If you have been practicing something else,
    you may attend two or three Vipassana courses to help you decide which technique
    you prefer. Then choose the one you find most suitable and beneficial, and devote
    yourself to it.
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>Telling Others About Vipassana</h3>
    </center>
    
    You may describe the technique to others, but do not teach them. Otherwise you
    might confuse rather than help them. Encourage people who want to meditate to join
    a course, where there is a properly trained guide.
    
    <hr>
    
    <center>
    <h3>In General</h3>
    </center>
    
    Progress comes gradually. Mistakes are bound to be made-learn from them. When
    you realize you have made an error, smile and start again!
    
    It is common to experience drowsiness, agitation, mind-wandering and other difficulties
    in meditation, but if you persevere you will be successful.
    
    You are welcome to contact the Teachers or Assistant Teachers for guidance.
    
    Make use of the support of your fellow meditators. Sitting with them will give you
    strength.
    
    Make use of the meditative atmosphere at centers or Dhamma houses by going there
    to sit whenever you can, even for a few days or hours. As an old student you are also
    welcome to come for part of a ten-day course, depending on the availability of space,
    and assuming you have been practicing this technique of Vipassana only.
    
    Real wisdom is recognizing and accepting that every experience is impermanent.
    With this insight you will not be overwhelmed by ups and downs. And when you
    are able to maintain an inner balance, you can choose to act in ways that will create
    happiness for you and for others. Living each moment happily with an equanimous
    mind, you will surely progress toward the ultimate goal of liberation from all
    suffering.

    </center>

    in roman pali notation. Unfortunately, limitations of this medium make it impossible to include the

    <h3>A Message From Goenkaji</h3>
    </center>
    
    <i>Dear Travelers on the Path of Dhamma,
    </i>
    
    <i>Be happy!
    Keep the torch of Dhamma alight! Let it shine brightly in your daily life. Always remember, Dhamma is not an escape.
    It is an art of living: living in peace and harmony with oneself and also with all others.
    Hence, try to live a Dhamma life.
    Don't miss your daily sittings each morning and evening.
    Whenever possible, attend weekly joint sittings with other Vipassana meditators.
    Do a ten-day course as an annual retreat. This is essential to keep you going strong.
    With all confidence, face the spikes around you bravely and smilingly.
    Renounce hatred and aversion, ill will and animosity.
    Generate love and compassion, especially for those who do not understand Dhamma and are living
    an unhappy life.
    May your Dhamma behavior show them the path of peace and harmony. May the glow of Dhamma on
    your faces attract more and more suffering people to this path of real happiness.
    </i><i>May all beings be happy, peaceful, liberated.</i>
    
    <i>
    </i><i>With all my metta,</i>
