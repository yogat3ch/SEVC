The photo gallery below shows the current accommodations at Dhamma Patapa. Construction is on-going with the emphasis on new buildings providing private rooms with private bathrooms.
People of all sexual and gender identities are welcome to our courses. If you would like specific accommodations for your sexual or gender identity please [read more="read more" less="read less"]  The campuses at all the meditation centers in this tradition​ separate male​s​ and female​s. ​This extends to the residential accommodations, the walking areas, the dining rooms, and the meditation hall. This structure is designed to reduce any possible distractions that could arise from the mixing of genders. We recognize this doesn’t work for everyone and that sometimes people in the LGBTQ​I​ community may not feel comfortable on either side of the compound, or having to identify as male or female. If the gender binary segregation is a concern for you, please <a href="mailto:info@patapa.dhamma.org" target="_blank">let us know</a> beforehand; this will allow us to provide accommodations with a private bath where you can feel undistracted while you meditate. You can let us know about your concerns by writing something on the application where we ask, “Anything you wish to add to the above information?”​ ​ We will contact you​,​ and together we will make a plan that works for you. Anything you tell us will be kept confidential.​ [/read]
