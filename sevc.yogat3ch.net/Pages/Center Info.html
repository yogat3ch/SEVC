    <h3 class="text-center">The Appearance of Dhamma in a Quiet Forest in Georgia</h3>
    The past several years have been a time of continued growth for the Southeast Vipassana Center, Dhamma Patapa. Collectively, the students of the Southeast region have created a home for the serious practice of Dhamma in rural Georgia. In its brief existence, Dhamma Patapa has undertaken an ambitious program of courses, completed a successful beautification project, built a new Dhamma hall, new male dormitory, new male and female dining annexes, two assistant teacher's residences, expanded parking lot, an administrative office, and added two Long Term Server cabins. Several thousand students have come to either sit or serve at Dhamma Patapa, all of whom have made important contributions to this flourishing new Center. Requests for enrollment in courses far exceed the Center’s capacity.
    
    The time has come to expand the Center once again. It's a pivotal juncture as we take this next step toward realizing the full potential of Dhamma Patapa -- “The Majesty of Dhamma.”
    
    Realizing this potential will require the dynamic involvement and enthusiastic support of the Old Students of the Southeast region.
    <h4 class="text-center">Renewed Growth</h4>
    Soon after opening there were extensive wait-lists, often for many months ahead. This situation has required great resourcefulness to enroll as many students as possible despite the limitations of the facilities as they exist. Understanding this, the Southeast Vipassana Association (SEVA) Trustees have worked to address the critical need to increase student capacity.
    
    Our immediate goal is to build a 4 bedroom residence that will accommodate up to eight more students. It will include one handicap accessible room.  Each bedroom will have its own bathroom and three will have meditation cells.  Situated on the border of the male and female sections, the dormitory will act as flex-housing and will serve either gender depending upon the needs of any given course.
    
    The flex-housing project will cost approximately $120,000.  As with all Vipassana Centers, Dhamma Patapa is growing because of the time, effort, volition, and resources freely given by Old Students. In past experience, once construction is under way, additional dana has always come forth. Monthly pledges - ongoing donations - will also need to increase to cover student and bank loan payments. These critical financial components are all necessary for the project to move forward to successful completion. Old Student volunteer construction work can also be a great help by keeping construction costs down.
    
    <strong class="text-center">The Center Development Committee (CDC), with Trust approval, has completed a floor plan.</strong>

    <h4 class="text-center">The Vision: A Thriving Center of Dhamma</h4>
    Ultimately, Dhamma Patapa will comprise a cluster of buildings centered around a pagoda with meditation cells for up to 120 Old Students. The main meditation hall will be at one end, with the dining hall/kitchen building at the other. Various groupings of student residences will arc between these two points. Covered and screened walkways will connect most of the buildings to offer protection from weather and insects.
    
    The final goal is to have a Center that will accommodate 120 students with individual rooms and baths, housing for Assistant Teachers, course servers, and long-term servers. These buildings will be neatly tucked away in a forested area on the highest elevation on the property with consideration for the least amount of environmental impact.

    <h4 class="text-center">Construction Plans: Phase II</h4>
    The Phase II Construction plan was a stepping stone to the ultimate Center vision with some of the buildings in this phase expected to have a different end use in the final version. Careful planning to ensure that all these parts fit together in efficient ways has been foremost.
    
    The realities of a limited budget and the effort needed to build an entire Center have forced CDC to think with great creativity and flexibility. The construction budget for Phase II was approximately $500,000. You may give a <a href="/donation/" target="_blank">Donation/Dana</a> for future expansion projects.

    The structure that will eventually become the dining facility in the final vision serves in the interim as the Dhamma Hall capable of seating sixty to seventy students with ten meditation cells.

    A new male residence has been built with a connected bath block which may also be used by male students residing in additional cottages or tents. Due to the relatively inexpensive modular design of each of the buildings in the plan, additional accommodations with individual bathrooms will be built as funds become available. It is hoped that this will be possible within the next one to two years.

    A pair of temporary annexes provide the necessary dining seating for men and women. These movable buildings will eventually be converted into long-term server or Assistant Teacher accommodations.
    
    Both Male and Female Assistant Teacher cottages have been built on either side of the Dhamma Hall. They may eventually become course manager’s accommodations once the final Dhamma Hall is constructed in Phase III.

    <h4 class="text-center">The Continuing Growth of Dhamma</h4>
    As with all Vipassana Centers, Dhamma Patapa is growing solely because of the time, effort, volition and resources freely given by Old Students. For those who wish to be part of this growth, there are many ways to participate. Dana is always welcome and necessary for continued operation and expansion. Loans for construction can provide leverage for taking large steps. Committee work which can be done from afar alleviates some of the work load from the students who manage the Center. And, of course, Dhamma Patapa depends upon volunteers who serve on site whether in the kitchen, working outside on landscaping, managing courses, or maintaining the infrastructure.
    
    There are openings and many opportunities to help expand Dhamma Patapa and the teaching of Dhamma. While volunteers with construction skills are especially helpful, there are plenty of opportunities for people with other skills: cooking during work periods; sewing curtains; landscaping; construction site clean up; assembling furniture; installing shelving; painting new signs; etc. Those interested in construction work may <a href="/dwcc-application/" target="_blank">apply here.</a>
