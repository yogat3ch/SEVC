<p>The success of the construction projects at Dhamma PatƒÅpa depends significantly on the support received from Old Students in this tradition. The Center Development Committee (CDC), which oversees these projects, is hopeful that a strong base of Old Students will be able to participate in the ongoing build-out of the Center. In order to proceed with a construction crew comprised of Old Students, a firm time commitment is needed. Therefore, in completing the Dhamma Workers Construction Crew (DWCC) Application Form, please be certain to consider carefully your commitment dates. 
Skilled and unskilled workers are welcome to apply. Those with specific skills, e.g. general contracting, carpentry, roofing, plumbing, electrical, tiling, installing sheet rock, etc. are very helpful. If you have relevant skills, please make note of it in the <a href="#dwcc">DWCC Application Form</a>.

Being Old Students, members of the Dhamma Workers Construction Crew must follow the <a href="http://www.dhamma.org/os/dwcode.htm" target="_blank">Code of Conduct for Dhamma Workers</a> while serving at the Center. Specifically, Dhamma workers are expected to:</p>
<ol style="clear: left">
	<li>Maintain the five precepts at all times both on and off the Center property.</li>
	<li>Participate in daily meditation before and after work.</li>
	<li>Take time to rest by meditating or, on occasion, leave the Center to rejuvenate in a more relaxed setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Construction crew participants must also agree to follow the instructions of the Project Manager and Center Managers alike.
The Southeast Vipassana Center will provide the following to the members of the Dhamma Worker Construction Crew:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All meals while on site</li>
	<li>Accomodations</li>
	<li>Construction supervision</li>
	<li>Tools (if you have your own tools, you are encouraged to bring them)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Trust is also willing to provide financial assistance for those who would not otherwise be able to volunteer their time.  This assistance will be on a case-by-case basis, and will be given to Old Students who have specific construction skills or who are able to participate as a member of the DWCC for a substantial period of time.
