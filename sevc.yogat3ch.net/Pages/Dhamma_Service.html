The giving of Dhamma Service, whether on a course or in some other way to help the spread of Dhamma, is one of the most
valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have. Not only is it rewarding to know that you have helped others to
taste the Nectar of Dhamma, it also is a wonderful source of growth and strength in one's own development in meditation
practice.

Without the voluntary assistance of Old Students who feel a volition to give to others a little of what they have
received from their participation in Vipassana courses, the courses cannot be arranged and conducted.

Goenkaji has spoken often on the&nbsp;<a href="./purpose-of-dhamma-service/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">purpose of Dhamma service</a>&nbsp;and teaches that it is an integral part of an Old
Student's growth and development on this path. Giving Dhamma service in accordance with the&nbsp;<a
  href="http://www.dhamma.org/en/dscode.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code of Conduct for Dhamma
  Workers</a>&nbsp;strengthens a student of Vipassana for living a Dhamma life in the outside world.

There are opportunities for all Old Students to participate and gain the wonderful benefit of giving Dhamma Service in
several different ways.

<h4>Serving on Courses</h4>
If you can volunteer your time serving one or more 10-day courses either full-time or part-time, please complete
the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dhamma.org/en/schedules/schpatapa.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dhamma
  Service Application On-line</a>&nbsp;when applying for a course. (Use the standard on-line application and mark the
box for Dhamma Service).

<hr id="regularservice">

<h4>Serving on a Regular Basis at the Center</h4>
Old Students are needed who can serve regularly during the especially busy days of a course such as at the beginning to
help get the kitchen up and running smoothly and at the end of a course to help coordinate the clean up with the
students.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;<a href="https://patapa.dhamma.org/contact-us/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">contact the Center</a>&nbsp;if you are able to come to the Center on a regular basis (every
2 weeks, once a month, or every other month) to help coordinate during the busy days of a course's beginning and
end.&nbsp; Additionally, you may serve during the “Between Course Service Period” to get the Center cleaned and reset
for the next course.&nbsp; If you have two or three days to serve monthly or bi-monthly, we'd love to hear from you, and
familiarize you with the Center so you may help coordinate activities during these important periods.

    alt="" width="125" height="208">Serving During Work Periods (Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter)</h4>
Dhamma Service Work Periods have a more relaxed schedule that includes three daily group sittings, work on seasonal
projects, and special evening discourses. Projects include gardening, light maintenance, sewing, deep cleaning and more
complex skilled projects that can't be done during courses. There is often an opportunity to meet with a local assistant
teacher, as well as the opportunity to serve with many fellow meditators over three delicious meals a day.&nbsp; This
program is for all Old Students who have sat at least one course with S.N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers and
who have not practiced another meditation technique since their last course. Such Old Students may serve all or part of
the program. View the schedule and apply&nbsp;<a href="http://courses.dhamma.org/en-US/schedules/schpatapa"

<hr id="longterm">

<h4>Long-Term Servers</h4>
Long-term servers have been the sustaining force at the Center. The long-term Dhamma server program is set up to
accommodate those who have from two to twelve months to spend giving service at the Center. Servers begin by applying
for a couple of courses, and if the Center atmosphere is mutually beneficial they may then complete a long-term server
application and have an interview with the Center Management and the Center Teachers. Most long-term servers serve on
courses, however, after some time they may move into other work such as landscaping, office or committee work.
Presently, the Center has long-term server cabins for those staying at the Center for extended periods of time.

A major role for Dhamma servers is in Center management. Periodically, openings become available for Center managers and
other management roles. Interested persons may <a href="https://patapa.dhamma.org/contact-us/" target="_blank"

<h5>Adopting-A-Job</h5>
Over and above the work done by Old Students who serve 10-day courses, there are some jobs that require short-term
commitment and very little technical and construction skills. They are less time consuming - yet are very important in
maintaining the Center and Dhamma activities in the Southeast. See the&nbsp;<a href="./adopt-a-job/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">listing and job descriptions</a>.
