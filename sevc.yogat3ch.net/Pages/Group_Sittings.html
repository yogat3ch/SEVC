For those who have just completed their first ten-day course, we would like to warmly welcome you and offer encouragement in developing your personal practice of Vipassana. Group sittings are valuable opportunities to strengthen your practice of Vipassana. By sitting with fellow students who are following the same technique, you can meditate more seriously and gain support which will help you to keep practicing on your own.

The following guidelines are established to ensure that group sittings will be most beneficial to the students attending them:
<div>
<ol>
 	<li>Group sittings are open only to those who have taken at least one ten-day course with S. N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers.</li>
 	<li>The <strong>five precepts of wholesome conduct are to be observed in the place where group sittings are held.</strong> These precepts include abstention from the following: killing any living creature, stealing, wrong speech, sexual misconduct, and the use of intoxicating drugs or alcohol. Observation of wholesome conduct is a necessary foundation for the practice of Vipassana.</li>
 	<li>Participants at group sittings <strong>should practice only the meditation technique taught by S.N Goenka.</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
May group sittings help your practice of Dhamma.
