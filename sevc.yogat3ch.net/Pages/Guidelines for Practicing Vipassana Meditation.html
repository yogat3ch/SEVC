<CENTER><H1>Vipassana Meditation</H1></CENTER>
<hr/>
<p>A Vipassana course is truly valuable only if it makes a change in your life, and a change
will come only if you keep practicing the technique on a daily basis.
The following outline of what you have learned is offered with best wishes
for your continued success in meditation.</p><BR>

<CENTER><H3>Sila</H3></CENTER>

<ul>
	In daily life this is practiced by following the Five Precepts:<BR>
	
	<li>to abstain from killing any being,</li>
	
	<li>to abstain from stealing,</li>
	
	<li>to abstain from sexual misconduct,</li>
	
	<li>to abstain from wrong speech,</li>
	
	<li>to abstain from all intoxicants.</li>
</ul>


<hr/>

<CENTER><H3>Meditation</H3></CENTER>

The minimum needed to maintain the practice:<BR>
<ul>
<li>one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening,</li>

<li>five minutes while lying in bed before you fall asleep and after you wake up,</li>

<li>if possible, sitting once a week for one hour with other meditators practicing this technique of Vipassana,</li>

<li>a ten-day course or self-course once a year,</li>

<li>and other free time for meditation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to meditate in daily practice:</h4><BR>

<STRONG>Anapana</STRONG><BR>
<p>
Practice this if the mind is dull or agitated, if it is difficult to feel sensations or
difficult not to react to them. You can begin with Anapana and then switch to
Vipassana or, if needed, continue observing the breath for the entire hour. To
practice Anapana, keep the attention in the area below the nostrils and above
the upper lip. Remain aware of each breath as it enters or leaves. If the mind
is very dull or very agitated, breathe deliberately and slightly harder for some
time. Otherwise, the breathing should be natural.
</p>
<STRONG>Vipassana</STRONG><BR>

<p>Move your attention systematically from head to feet and from feet to head,
observing in order each and every part of the body by feeling all the sensations
that you come across. Observe objectively; that is, remain equanimous with all
the sensations that you experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, by
appreciating their impermanent nature. Keep your attention moving. Never
stay for more than a few minutes at any one place. Do not allow the practice
to become mechanical. Work in different ways according to the type of sensations
you experience. Areas of the body having different gross sensations
should be observed separately by moving the attention part by part. Symmetrical
parts, such as both arms or both legs, having similar subtle sensations, may
be observed together simultaneously. If you experience subtle sensations
throughout the physical structure, you may at times sweep the entire body and
then again work part by part.
</p>
<STRONG>Metta</STRONG><BR>

<p>At the end of the hour relax, letting any mental or physical agitation subside.
Then focus your attention for a few minutes on subtle sensations in the body,
and fill your mind and body with thoughts and feelings of goodwill for all
beings.
</p>
<hr/>


<CENTER><H3>Outside of Meditation Periods</H3></CENTER>

<p>
Give your full and undivided attention to any important tasks before you, but check
from time to time whether you are maintaining your awareness and equanimity. Whenever a problem
arises, if possible be aware of your breath or sensations, even for a few seconds.
This will help you to remain balanced in various situations.
</p>
<STRONG>Dana</STRONG><BR>

<p>Share whatever good you have acquired with others. Doing so helps to eradicate the
old habit of self-centeredness. Meditators realize that the most valuable thing they
have to share is Dhamma. Not being able to teach, they do what they can to help
others learn the technique. With this pure volition they donate toward the expenses
of other students.
</p>
<p>This <I>dana</I> is the sole source of funding for courses and centers around the world.
</p>
<hr/>


<CENTER><H3>Selfless Service</H3></CENTER>

<p>
A still greater <I>dana</I> is to give of one's time and effort by helping to organize or run
courses or by doing other Dhamma work. All who help (including the Teachers and
Assistant Teachers) give their service as <I>dana</I> without receiving anything in return.
This service not only benefits others, but also helps those offering it to eradicate
egotism. to understand the teaching more deeply, and thus to advance on the path.
</p>
<hr/>


<CENTER><H3>One Path Only</H3></CENTER>
<p>
Do not mix this technique with others. If you have been practicing something else,
you may attend two or three Vipassana courses to help you decide which technique
you prefer. Then choose the one you find most suitable and beneficial, and devote
yourself to it.
</p>
<hr/>



<CENTER><H3>Telling Others About Vipassana</H3></CENTER>
<p>
You may describe the technique to others, but do not teach them. Otherwise you
might confuse rather than help them. Encourage people who want to meditate to join
a course, where there is a properly trained guide.
</p>
<hr/>


<CENTER><H3>In General</H3></CENTER>
<p>
Progress comes gradually. Mistakes are bound to be made-learn from them. When
you realize you have made an error, smile and start again! <br>
<br>
It is common to experience drowsiness, agitation, mind-wandering and other difficulties
in meditation, but if you persevere you will be successful.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to contact the Teachers or Assistant Teachers for guidance.<br>
<br>
Make use of the support of your fellow meditators. Sitting with them will give you
strength.<br>
<br>
Make use of the meditative atmosphere at centers or Dhamma houses by going there
to sit whenever you can, even for a few days or hours. As an old student you are also
welcome to come for part of a ten-day course, depending on the availability of space,
and assuming you have been practicing this technique of Vipassana only.<br>
<br>
Real wisdom is recognizing and accepting that every experience is impermanent.
With this insight you will not be overwhelmed by ups and downs. And when you
are able to maintain an inner balance, you can choose to act in ways that will create
happiness for you and for others. Living each moment happily with an equanimous
mind, you will surely progress toward the ultimate goal of liberation from all
suffering.

<CENTER><H3>A Message From Goenkaji</H3></CENTER>


<I>Dear Travelers on the Path of Dhamma,<BR>

Be happy!<BR>

Keep the torch of Dhamma alight! Let it shine brightly in your daily life. Always remember, Dhamma is not an escape.
It is an art of living: living in peace and harmony with oneself and also with all others.
Hence, try to live a Dhamma life.<BR>

Don't miss your daily sittings each morning and evening.<BR>

Whenever possible, attend weekly joint sittings with other Vipassana meditators.<BR>

Do a ten-day course as an annual retreat. This is essential to keep you going strong.<BR>

With all confidence, face the spikes around you bravely and smilingly.<BR>

Renounce hatred and aversion, ill will and animosity.<BR>

Generate love and compassion, especially for those who do not understand Dhamma and are living
an unhappy life.<BR>

May your Dhamma behavior show them the path of peace and harmony. May the glow of Dhamma on
your faces attract more and more suffering people to this path of real happiness.<BR>

May all beings be happy, peaceful, liberated.<BR>
With all my metta,</I><BR>
