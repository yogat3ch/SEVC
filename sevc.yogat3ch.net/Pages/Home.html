<h5><a href="https://patapa.dhamma.org/vipassana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipassana</a>, which means to see things as they really are, is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. The non-sectarian technique of Vipassana was taught by the Buddha more than 2500 years ago as a universal remedy for universal ills.
