<h2 style="text-align: center;">Local Outreach</h2>
<strong>The Goal of Local Outreach</strong> is to increase awareness of Vipassana Meditation and 10-day courses as taught by S.N.Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin.

The following Outreach activities may be organized locally by established Old Students, based upon their level of practice, confidence, interest, and tools that are available.

Activities:
<ul>
 	<li>Word of mouth to small groups, friends, neighbors, and associates</li>
 	<li>Presentations at colleges, universities, libraries, and health clubs</li>
 	<li>Presentations at volunteer organizations, hospitals, and to hospice staff</li>
 	<li>Presentations at business, cultural, and religious organizations</li>
 	<li>Booths at malls, festivals, and other public events</li>
 	<li>Public talks about Vipassana by senior Teachers/Authors</li>
</ul>
All Old Students are encouraged to spread the word about Vipassana Meditation, only answering questions which relate to the logistics of the course, e.g. schedules, boarding, lodging, food, and facilities, etc. They may also share their personal experience and the benefits that were achieved after attending a 10-day course. Under no circumstances should the actual teaching of the technique of Anapana and Vipassana be discussed. This should be left to the teachers and assistant teachers.

Announcements about Vipassana activities in your area may be made via telephone, e-mail, websites, local newspapers, magazines, etc. This must be done without incurring any Trust funds. All outreach activities are supported by local Old Students with the exception of major events that are organized and approved by the Trust.

<strong>Major Events:</strong>

Public talks and other events about Vipassana meditation are periodically scheduled to provide interested persons with information about the technique and its benefits in daily life. Events organized by the Trust for the Southeast Region are normally announced on a website established for that event and made available to all Old Students.

Films such as "The Dhamma Brothers" and "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana" may be shown locally on a regular basis. These powerful documentaries about the teaching of Vipassana meditation in the prison systems in the US and India, respectively, and the remarkable results which were achieved in terms of changes in the attitudes and behavior of the inmates who participated.

All Old Students are encouraged to invite family, friends, neighbors, and associates to such events and also promote the events to the general public using fliers, local websites, magazines, newspapers, etc. Following the video showings and Vipassana lectures, there are opportunities for the attendees to ask questions and talk informally with the presenter.
