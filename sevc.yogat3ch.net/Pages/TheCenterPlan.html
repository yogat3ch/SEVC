<p>Each year the Dhamma Patapa Center Plan is revised and updated.  The purpose of this document is to capture the consensus opinion on the status and direction of the Center's development as it relates to a current service year, composed of current Trust members, Friends-of-the-Trust, other Old Students, and supervising Assistant Teachers.</p>
<p>The plan is designed to provide an orientation to new Trust members and other Old Students whose service could benefit from understanding this consensus. The plan is organized by the primary elements of the Center, from its physical plant and staffing to its relationship with an adjacent intentional community of Old Students.</p>
