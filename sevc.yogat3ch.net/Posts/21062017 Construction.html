<h2 class="text-center">SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM DHAMMA PATAPA’S CENTER DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE</h2>
 <p>Long waiting lists for all courses and overcrowding are motivating the need to expand accommodations for both women and men. 
 In an effort to move toward our vision of an ideal meditation center, plans have been developed for new residences that will consist only of private rooms which include a meditation cell.
<div class="text-center"><a href="http://sevc.yogat3ch.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/floorplan.jpg"><img class="matte aligncenter" src="http://sevc.yogat3ch.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/floorplan-290x300.jpg" alt="Floorplan" width="290" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1070" /></a> [wp_colorbox_media url="http://sevc.yogat3ch.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/floorplan.jpg" type="image" hyperlink="click here to open image"]</div>
Since 2008, Dhamma Patapa grew from accommodating 30 students to nearly 60. Now is the time to add more residential space and improve the quality of the students’ experience by providing more private quarters. Construction is scheduled to begin December 2016 / January 2017.</p>

<blockquote>Vipassana centers must always radiate love and goodwill so that all who come feel that they have entered a sanctuary of peace. May each and every center become a true dwelling of Dhamma, in the shelter of which many may find the way out of suffering."
